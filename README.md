### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Konstantin Tenman, a seasoned software developer.

**My favorite topics include:**

- Software craftsmanship
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Pair programming
- Java / Kotlin
- Web development (TypeScript, Vue, Svelte)
- Open-source contributions
- Conferences and community engagement

With ten years of industry experience, specializing in Java development for the past eight, I excel in creating
high-quality, scalable, and maintainable code. I am good at working under pressure and thrive on fast-paced, challenging
projects requiring problem-solving and attention to detail.

I enjoy working with teams to bring innovative, rigorously tested applications to market and follow continuous delivery
practices. I am looking for a very forward-thinking organization; I have the potential to add value and share my passion
for delivering outstanding software.
